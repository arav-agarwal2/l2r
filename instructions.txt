Step 1: Please complete and upload the completed form, in order to obtain the simulator: https://www.aicrowd.com/clef_tasks/82/task_dataset_files?challenge_id=954
        You will receive a temporary download link from which to download the simulator
        You will need GPU to run the simulator
        An example of AWS EC2 instance that you can use is:
                - Deep Learning AMI (Ubuntu 18.04) Version 40.0
                - g4dn.xlarge
                - 150 GB Root Storage
Step 2: Clone the repository (git clone https://github.com/learn-to-race/l2r.git)
Step 3: Install requirements: pip3 install -r requirements.txt
Step 4: Configure your experiment settings in the relevent config files (l2r/l2r/configs)
        The config file for running the random agent is 'params_random.yaml'
        The config file for running the sac agent is 'params_sac.yaml'
        Set 'sim_path' to the path where your simulator has been downloaded
        Set 'save_path' to where you would like to save your results
Step 5: Execute the run.bash script in the l2r folder (l2r/l2r) to run the agent:
        Command to execute the random agent: ./run.bash -b 'random'
        Command to execute the SAC agent: ./run.bash -b 'sac'
Step 6: Analyze results (l2r/l2r/results)
        Your run log file will be f'{save_path}run_log.txt'
        Navigate to l2r/results
        Run get_results.py to convert the data in the log file into a csv
                - It takes in the log file name as the command line parameter
        Run graph_results.py to run the graphing application
                - It takes the output csv file of get_results.py as a parameter
                - streamlit run graph_results.py <csv_file_name>
